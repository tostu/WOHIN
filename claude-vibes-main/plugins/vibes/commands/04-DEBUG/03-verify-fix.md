# Verify Phase

You are helping a vibe coder confirm their fix works and doesn't break anything else. This is the quality gate—fixes that pass verification get documented in LOGS.json.

Specific area to verify: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Role

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool for ANY question to the user. Never ask questions as plain text output.** The AskUserQuestion tool ensures a guided, interactive experience with structured options. Every single user question must go through this tool.

You orchestrate the verification and manage the conversation. The verifier agent handles thorough testing, while you present findings and manage the approval/documentation cycle.

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Task tool to launch the verification agents.** Do not verify the fix yourself—that's what the verifier and tester agents are for.

## Interactive Experience (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool when interacting with the user.** This ensures a guided, interactive experience:

Use AskUserQuestion to:
- Clarify what "fixed" should look like when unsure
- Ask about edge cases discovered during verification
- Present trade-offs when issues are found
- Get approval before documenting in LOGS.json

Never assume verification criteria. Ask to confirm.

## Project Context

**Always read these files for core context:**
- `docs/01-START/` files — Project requirements and architecture
- `docs/04-DEBUG/diagnosis-*.md` — The diagnosis for this fix

These are stable documentation—always load them. The verifier agent will parse LOGS.json and report back specific relevant entries.

**Fallback if docs/01-START/ doesn't exist:**
If these files don't exist (common when using claude-vibes on an existing project), explore the codebase directly to understand the project's structure, patterns, and conventions.

**Fallback if no diagnosis file exists:**
If no diagnosis file exists, use `git diff` and `git log` to understand what was changed, and use AskUserQuestion to understand what the fix was supposed to accomplish.

## How to Communicate

- Be clear about what passed and what failed
- Explain any regressions in plain language
- Celebrate when everything works
- Use AskUserQuestion for decisions about edge cases

## Verify Process

### 1. Load Core Context

Read docs/01-START/ files and the most recent diagnosis file to understand what was fixed.

### 2. Identify What to Verify

If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies files/areas, focus there.

Otherwise, find the recent fix:
- Check `git diff` for uncommitted changes
- Read the most recent `docs/04-DEBUG/diagnosis-*.md`
- Look at recently modified files

### 3. Launch Agents in Parallel (REQUIRED)

**You MUST use the Task tool to launch BOTH agents simultaneously** — they verify the fix from different angles and don't depend on each other. Use `subagent_type: "claude-vibes:verifier"` and `subagent_type: "claude-vibes:tester"`.

**Verifier Agent** (confirm fix works, check regressions):

> Ultrathink about verifying this fix.
>
> **What was fixed:** [from diagnosis file]
> **Files changed:** [from git diff or diagnosis]
>
> **Parse LOGS.json for context (if it exists):**
> - Find related past fixes to inform testing
> - Identify patterns that should be verified
> - Check for areas that commonly regress
> - If LOGS.json doesn't exist, skip this and focus on direct verification
>
> **Verify thoroughly:**
> - Test the specific issue that was fixed (does it work now?)
> - Run related tests (do existing tests still pass?)
> - Check for regressions (did we break anything else?)
> - Verify edge cases mentioned in the diagnosis
>
> **Use AskUserQuestion during verification:**
> - If you're unsure what "fixed" should look like, ask the user to describe expected behavior
> - If you find an edge case that wasn't covered, ask if it's important
> - If verification reveals unclear requirements, ask for clarification
> - If you're unsure whether a behavior change is acceptable, ask
>
> **Report back with specific references:**
> - Cite specific LOGS.json entry IDs that are relevant (e.g., "entry-042")
> - Quote the relevant portions from those entries
> - Specific test results (what passed, what failed)
> - Whether the original issue is resolved
> - Any regressions found
> - LOGS.json entry recommendation with:
>   - symptom, rootCause, summary, details, prevention
>   - files modified, tags, area
>
> This allows the main session to read those specific references without parsing all of LOGS.json.
> Be specific about verification results.

**Tester Agent** (write tests that prove the fix):

> Ultrathink about testing this fix to prove it works.
>
> **What was fixed:** [from diagnosis file]
> **Files changed:** [from git diff or diagnosis]
>
> **Your mission:**
> - Write tests that would have caught the original bug
> - Write tests that prove the fix works
> - Run the tests yourself—don't ask the user to run them
> - If tests fail, analyze and fix the issues
> - Iterate until all tests pass
> - Only fall back to manual testing instructions if automation is impossible
>
> **Test coverage should include:**
> - The exact scenario that caused the bug
> - Edge cases related to the fix
> - Regression tests to prevent the bug from returning
> - Integration points affected by the fix
>
> **Use AskUserQuestion during testing:**
> - If you're unsure what the correct behavior should be, ask
> - If tests reveal ambiguous requirements, ask for clarification
> - If you find additional bugs, ask about priority
> - If you need to understand the original bug better, ask the user to describe it
>
> **Report back with:**
> - Tests written that prove the fix works
> - Tests that would have caught the original bug
> - Test results (all passing or issues found)
> - Any additional bugs found during testing
> - Manual testing instructions (only if something couldn't be automated)
> - Confidence level that the fix is solid
>
> The vibe coder should just see results—you do the work.

### 4. Combine Results

After BOTH agents return:

**From Verifier:**
- Load specific LOGS.json entries it cited
- Note whether original issue is fixed
- Note any regressions found

**From Tester:**
- Note tests written and what they prove
- Note test results (passing/failing)
- Note confidence level

### 5. Present Combined Findings

**If all verifications pass:**
```
Verification & Testing Complete — Fix Confirmed!

VERIFICATION:
- Original issue: FIXED
- Related tests: All passing
- Regressions: None found

TESTING:
- Tests written: 6 (regression tests for the bug)
- Tests passing: 6/6
- This bug can't come back now!
- Confidence: HIGH

The fix is solid and ready to ship.
```

**If issues found:**
```
Verification & Testing Found Problems

VERIFICATION:
1. REGRESSION: Test 'userSearch' now fails
   File: tests/search.test.ts
   Expected: Results for "café"
   Got: Empty array

2. PARTIAL FIX: Original issue fixed for ASCII, but Unicode still fails
   File: src/api/search.ts:52

TESTING:
- Tests written: 4
- Tests passing: 2/4
- The bug still occurs in some scenarios

These need to be addressed before shipping.
```

Use AskUserQuestion for judgment calls:
- "The main issue is fixed, but I found an unrelated failing test. Should we fix that too or track it separately?"

### 6. Iterate if Needed

If issues exist:
1. Explain what's wrong clearly
2. Offer to go back and fix them
3. Re-run verification after fixes

"I found 1 regression. Want me to fix it now?"

### 7. Document in LOGS.json

**Only when verification passes** (no regressions, fix confirmed working):

Write to LOGS.json with this entry structure:
```json
{
  "id": "entry-<timestamp>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "phase": "fix",
  "type": "fix",
  "area": "<domain area where bug occurred>",
  "symptom": "<what the user observed>",
  "rootCause": "<why it broke>",
  "summary": "<what was fixed>",
  "details": "<fuller description of the fix>",
  "prevention": "<how to prevent similar issues>",
  "patterns": ["<patterns followed in the fix>"],
  "files": ["<files modified>"],
  "tags": ["bug", "<error type>", "<area>"],
  "verifiedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "verifyNotes": "<any notes from verification>"
}
```

Create or update LOGS.json in the project root.

## Guidelines

- Always read docs/ and diagnosis for context
- Let the verifier explore LOGS.json; read only what it references
- The original issue must be confirmed fixed
- Regressions must be fixed before shipping
- Only write to LOGS.json after passing verification

## LOGS.json Write Rules

**Only write to LOGS.json when:**
1. Verification passes (no regressions)
2. Original issue confirmed fixed
3. Fix is ready to ship

**Include in the entry:**
- Symptom (what user saw)
- Root cause (why it happened)
- What was fixed and how
- Prevention advice for future
- Files touched and searchable tags

## Output

When verification is complete:

**If passed:**
1. Summary of what was verified
2. Confirmation the fix works
3. Any accepted trade-offs
4. Confirmation that LOGS.json was updated
5. Next steps:
   - `/03-SHIP/01-pre-commit` — Run pre-commit checks
   - `/03-SHIP/02-commit` — Just commit locally
   - `/03-SHIP/03-push` — Commit and push
   - `/03-SHIP/04-pr` — Commit, push, and create PR

**If failed:**
1. Clear list of issues found
2. How to fix each one
3. Offer to fix them
4. "Re-run `/03-verify-fix` after fixes"

### Store Verification Insights in Memory

**If verification revealed useful patterns or insights not already documented**, store them for future sessions.

**Use the memory MCP tools:**

1. **For verification patterns discovered:**
   ```
   Use create_entities or add_observations to store in "VerificationPatterns":
   - Testing strategies that worked well (e.g., "Always test the exact user input that caused the original bug")
   - Common regression areas (e.g., "Changes to UserService often regress email notifications")
   - Edge cases worth testing (e.g., "Always test with unicode characters after string handling fixes")
   ```

2. **For diagnostic knowledge:**
   ```
   Use create_entities or add_observations to store in "DiagnosticKnowledge":
   - Prevention insights (e.g., "Add input length limits to prevent this class of bug")
   - Root cause patterns (e.g., "This symptom always traces back to cache staleness")
   ```

**Only store NEW findings** — insights that will help verify similar fixes faster. If nothing notable was discovered, skip this step.

**Example observations to store:**
- "After fixing auth bugs, always verify both login AND logout flows"
- "The test suite doesn't cover async error paths — add manual checks for those"
- "Changes to the Order model often break the reporting dashboard"
