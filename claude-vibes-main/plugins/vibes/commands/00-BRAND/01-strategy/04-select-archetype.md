# Select Brand Archetype

You are helping a startup founder select their brand archetype using the 12 Jungian archetypes. This establishes the emotional personality foundation that guides all brand expression.

## Context Loading

**Founder Brief** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/01-founder-brief.md

**Audience Research** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/02-audience-research.md

**Competitive Audit** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/03-competitive-audit.md

**Brand Name** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/04-brand-name.md

**Purpose/Mission/Vision** (required):

## Your Role

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool for ANY question to the user. Never ask questions as plain text output.** The AskUserQuestion tool ensures a guided, interactive experience with structured options. Every single user question must go through this tool.

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Task tool to launch the brand-archetype-selector agent.** Do not select archetypes yourself — that's what the specialized agent is for.

Your job is to:
1. Verify prerequisites exist
2. Extract key context from loaded documents
3. Prepare a comprehensive, structured prompt for the agent
4. Launch the agent
5. Save and review the results

## Interactive Experience (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool when interacting with the user.** This ensures a guided, interactive experience where the founder feels engaged and consulted throughout the branding process.

Use AskUserQuestion to:
- Gather preferences before launching agents
- Present options with clear tradeoffs
- Validate agent outputs before saving
- Get feedback and iterate on results

Never save final outputs without user approval.

## Human-Sounding Writing Protocol

**BEFORE launching the brand-archetype-selector agent, you MUST:**

1. **Use the Skill tool** to invoke `claude-vibes:ai-writing-detection`
   - This loads expert-level knowledge of AI writing patterns to avoid

2. **Use the Sequential Thinking MCP tool (ultrathink)** to prepare AI-aware instructions:
   - Review vocabulary patterns to avoid: "delve", "tapestry", "multifaceted", "leverage", "crucial", "comprehensive", "foster", "harness", "navigate", "landscape", "realm", "beacon", "pivotal"
   - Review phrases to avoid: "It's important to note", "In today's fast-paced world", "At its core", "Let me explain"
   - Review structural patterns to avoid: uniform sentence lengths, excessive tricolons, em dash overuse (LLMs use em dashes formulaically to create "punched up" sales rhythms—swapping to commas doesn't help; vary your structures instead)

3. **Include AI-aware instructions** in the agent prompt so output is human-sounding from the start

## Launch the Agent

**Use Task tool** with `subagent_type: "claude-vibes:BRANDING:brand-archetype-selector"` and this prompt:

```
Select the brand archetype(s) for this startup. ultrathink

## FOUNDER CONTEXT

**Business**: [Extract from founder brief — what they do]
**Founder Personality**: [From founder brief — personality traits, style]
**Founder Motivation**: [Why they started — what drives them]
**What They Admire**: [From founder brief — brands/people they respect]

## PURPOSE FOUNDATION

**Purpose (WHY)**: [From purpose-mission-vision.md]
**Mission (HOW)**: [From purpose-mission-vision.md]
**Vision (WHERE)**: [From purpose-mission-vision.md]
**Core Values**: [From core-values.md if exists]

## AUDIENCE INSIGHTS

**Audience Aspirations**: [What customers aspire to]
**Audience Fears**: [What customers fear/avoid]
**Emotional Needs**: [What emotional needs you fulfill]

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

## POSITIONING CONTEXT

**Positioning Strategy**: [From positioning.md if exists]
**Emotional Territory to Own**: [From positioning — what feelings we want to claim]

## BRAND NAME

## CRITICAL: INTERACTIVE DISCOVERY

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool to ensure an interactive, guided experience:**
- Gather preferences and opinions before making recommendations
- Present options with clear tradeoffs for the user to choose from
- Validate findings and get feedback before proceeding
- Confirm final outputs resonate before saving

Never make significant decisions without user input. The brand identity belongs to them.

## DISCOVERY APPROACH

### Phase 1: Context Analysis
Analyze all inputs to understand:
- Brand purpose and values
- Target audience characteristics
- Competitive positioning
- Founder personality
- Desired emotional territory

### Phase 2: Audience Archetype Alignment
Understand what archetypes resonate with the target audience:
- What do they aspire to? (Hero, Ruler, Magician)
- What do they fear? (determines avoidance)
- What emotional needs do we fulfill?
- What brands do they love and why?

### Phase 3: Competitive Archetype Mapping
Map the competitive landscape:
- What archetype is each competitor?
- What archetypes are overused in this space?
- What archetypes are underrepresented?
- Is there white space for differentiation?

### Phase 4: Apply the 70/30 Rule
Select archetypes using the Mark-Pearson methodology:
- **Primary archetype (70%)** — core personality, aligned with purpose
- **Secondary archetype (30%)** — for differentiation
- Validate combinations are complementary, not conflicting

### Phase 5: Validate Selection
Run validation tests:
- **Authenticity Test**: Does this feel true to the founder?
- **Audience Test**: Does this resonate with customers?
- **Differentiation Test**: Does this stand out from competitors?
- **Consistency Test**: Can we express this across all touchpoints?
- **Shadow Test**: Can we avoid the archetype's dark side?

### Phase 6: Document Expression
Define how archetype manifests:
- Voice and personality traits
- Visual identity direction
- Experience guidelines
- Marketing approach

## TOOLS TO USE

- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Systematically evaluate each archetype against brand context, map competitive archetypes, validate combinations
- **AskUserQuestion**: Validate archetype resonates with founder's vision, get input on emotional territory
- **WebSearch**: Research archetype case studies, competitive brand analysis, successful archetype implementations
- **WebFetch**: Read competitor about pages and brand materials — understand their archetypal expression to differentiate

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Deliver the complete archetype documentation using the Archetype Documentation Template from the `brand-archetype-selection` skill. Must include:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Context Review** (purpose, values, audience, positioning)
3. **Audience Archetype Alignment** (what archetypes resonate)
4. **Competitive Archetype Landscape** (competitor mapping)
5. **Primary Archetype Recommendation** (full profile with rationale)
6. **Secondary Archetype Recommendation** (complement rationale)
7. **Alternative Archetypes Considered** (with fit scores)
8. **Archetype Expression Guide** (voice, visuals, experience)
9. **Shadow Side Analysis** (risks and mitigation)
10. **Quick Reference Card** (summary for daily use)
```

## Guidelines

- **Apply the 70/30 rule**: One clear primary, one complementary secondary
- **Authenticity matters**: The archetype must feel true to the founder
- **Audience alignment**: The archetype must resonate with customers
- **Competitive differentiation**: Consider what archetypes competitors use
- **Avoid the shadow**: Every archetype has a dark side to watch for
- **Consistency is key**: Once chosen, express the archetype consistently

## Output

After the agent returns:

1. Ensure `docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/` directory exists
2. Save to `docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/04-archetype.md`

3. **Next step:** "Run `/00-BRAND:01-strategy/05-define-voice` to define your brand personality and voice."
