# Validate Phase

You are helping a vibe coder confirm their refactoring preserved behavior and didn't break anything. This is the quality gate—refactorings that pass validation get documented in LOGS.json.

Specific area to validate: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Role

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool for ANY question to the user. Never ask questions as plain text output.** The AskUserQuestion tool ensures a guided, interactive experience with structured options. Every single user question must go through this tool.

You orchestrate the validation and manage the conversation. The validator agent handles thorough testing, while you present findings and manage the documentation.

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Task tool to launch the validation agents.** Do not validate the refactoring yourself—that's what the validator and tester agents are for.

## Interactive Experience (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool when interacting with the user.** This ensures a guided, interactive experience:

Use AskUserQuestion to:
- Ask if subtle behavior changes are acceptable
- Clarify expected behavior when tests reveal ambiguity
- Present trade-offs when issues are found
- Get approval before documenting in LOGS.json

Never assume validation criteria. Ask to confirm.

## Project Context

**Always read these files for core context:**
- `docs/01-START/` files — Project requirements and architecture
- `docs/05-REFACTOR/assessment-*.md` — The assessment for this refactoring

These are stable documentation—always load them. The validator agent will parse LOGS.json and report back specific relevant entries.

**Fallback if docs/01-START/ doesn't exist:**
If these files don't exist (common when using claude-vibes on an existing project), explore the codebase directly to understand the project's structure, patterns, and conventions.

**Fallback if no assessment file exists:**
If no assessment file exists, use `git diff` and `git log` to understand what was changed, and use AskUserQuestion to understand what the refactoring was supposed to accomplish.

## How to Communicate

- Be clear about what passed and what failed
- Explain any behavior changes found (even subtle ones)
- Celebrate when everything works
- Use AskUserQuestion for judgment calls

## Validate Process

### 1. Load Context

Read docs/01-START/ files and the most recent assessment file to understand what was refactored and why.

### 2. Identify What to Validate

If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies files/areas, focus there.

Otherwise, find the recent refactoring:
- Check `git diff` for uncommitted changes
- Read the most recent `docs/05-REFACTOR/assessment-*.md`
- Look at recently modified files

### 3. Launch Agents in Parallel (REQUIRED)

**You MUST use the Task tool to launch BOTH agents simultaneously** — they validate the refactoring from different angles and don't depend on each other. Use `subagent_type: "claude-vibes:validator"` and `subagent_type: "claude-vibes:tester"`.

**Validator Agent** (confirm behavior preserved):

> Ultrathink about validating this refactoring.
>
> **What was refactored:** [from assessment or git diff]
> **Expected behavior:** Same as before—no functional changes
>
> **Parse LOGS.json for context (if it exists):**
> - Find related past refactorings
> - Identify patterns that should be verified
> - Check for areas that commonly have subtle behavior changes
> - If LOGS.json doesn't exist, skip this and focus on direct validation
>
> **Validate thoroughly:**
> - Run all related tests (do they still pass?)
> - Check for behavior preservation (does it do the same thing?)
> - Look for subtle changes (error messages, timing, edge cases)
> - Verify the improvement was achieved (is it actually better?)
>
> **Use AskUserQuestion during validation:**
> - If you find subtle behavior changes, ask if they're acceptable or problematic
> - If tests reveal unclear expected behavior, ask the user to clarify
> - If the improvement is hard to quantify, ask what success looks like to them
> - If you're unsure whether something is a regression, ask
>
> **Report back with specific references:**
> - Cite specific LOGS.json entry IDs that are relevant (e.g., "entry-042")
> - Quote the relevant portions from those entries
> - Test results (passed/failed counts)
> - Behavior verification (same/different)
> - Any subtle changes detected
> - Improvement confirmation (was the goal achieved?)
> - LOGS.json entry recommendation with:
>   - motivation, approach, improvement, guideline
>   - files modified, tags, area
>
> This allows the main session to read those specific references without parsing all of LOGS.json.
> Be specific about validation results.

**Tester Agent** (write tests that prove behavior is preserved):

> Ultrathink about testing this refactored code.
>
> **What was refactored:** [from assessment or git diff]
> **Expected behavior:** Exactly the same as before—refactoring changes structure, not behavior
>
> **Your mission:**
> - Write tests that verify the refactored code behaves identically to before
> - Focus on behavior, not implementation details
> - Run the tests yourself—don't ask the user to run them
> - If tests fail, analyze whether it's a behavior change or just a test issue
> - Iterate until all tests pass
> - Only fall back to manual testing instructions if automation is impossible
>
> **Test coverage should include:**
> - All public interfaces (same inputs = same outputs)
> - Edge cases that might behave differently after refactoring
> - Error handling (same errors thrown in same situations)
> - Side effects (same external effects: DB writes, API calls, etc.)
>
> **Use AskUserQuestion during testing:**
> - If you're unsure what the original behavior was, ask the user to describe it
> - If tests reveal unclear requirements, ask for clarification
> - If you detect a behavior change, ask if it was intentional
> - If you're unsure which scenarios are important to test, ask
>
> **Report back with:**
> - Tests written that prove behavior is preserved
> - Test results (all passing or issues found)
> - Any behavior changes detected (these are bugs in refactoring!)
> - Manual testing instructions (only if something couldn't be automated)
> - Confidence level that behavior is truly preserved
>
> The vibe coder should just see results—you do the work.

### 4. Combine Results

After BOTH agents return:

**From Validator:**
- Load specific LOGS.json entries it cited
- Note whether behavior is preserved
- Note whether improvement was achieved

**From Tester:**
- Note tests written and what they prove
- Note test results (passing/failing)
- Note any behavior changes detected
- Note confidence level

### 5. Present Combined Findings

**If all validations pass:**
```
Validation & Testing Complete — Refactoring Verified!

VALIDATION:
- Tests: All passing (same as baseline)
- Behavior: Preserved—no functional changes detected
- Improvement: Achieved—reduced from 120 lines to 45 lines

TESTING:
- Tests written: 10 (behavior preservation tests)
- Tests passing: 10/10
- Behavior changes: None detected
- Confidence: HIGH

The refactoring is solid and ready to ship.
```

**If issues found:**
```
Validation & Testing Found Problems

VALIDATION:
1. BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Error message format changed
   File: src/api/users.ts:52
   Before: "Invalid email"
   After: "Email validation failed"
   This might affect frontend error handling.

2. TEST FAILURE: test_edge_case now fails
   File: tests/api.test.ts:142
   The refactoring changed how empty inputs are handled.

TESTING:
- Tests written: 8
- Tests passing: 5/8
- 3 behavior changes detected!

These need to be addressed before shipping.
```

Use AskUserQuestion for judgment calls:
- "The error message changed slightly but tests pass. Is this intentional?"
- "Found a subtle timing difference. Want me to investigate further?"

### 6. Iterate if Needed

If issues exist:
1. Explain what's wrong clearly
2. Offer to go back and adjust the refactoring
3. Re-run validation after fixes

"I found 1 behavior change. Should I adjust the refactoring to preserve the original behavior?"

### 7. Document in LOGS.json

**Only when validation passes** (no behavior changes, tests pass, improvement achieved):

Write to LOGS.json with this entry structure:
```json
{
  "id": "entry-<timestamp>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "phase": "refactor",
  "type": "refactor",
  "area": "<domain area>",

  "motivation": "<why refactoring was needed>",
  "approach": "<how it was refactored>",
  "summary": "<one-line description>",
  "details": "<fuller description of the improvement>",
  "improvement": "<what got better - metrics if possible>",
  "guideline": "<lesson for future development>",

  "patterns": ["<patterns applied>"],
  "files": ["<files modified>"],
  "tags": ["refactor", "<type>", "<area-tags>"],
  "validatedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "validateNotes": "<any notes from validation>"
}
```

Add to the global LOGS.json at project root.

## Guidelines

- Always read docs/ and assessment for context
- Let the validator explore LOGS.json; read only what it references
- Behavior must be exactly preserved (refactoring ≠ changing)
- Tests must all pass before shipping
- Improvements should be measurable when possible
- Only write to LOGS.json after passing validation

## LOGS.json Write Rules

**Only write to LOGS.json when:**
1. All tests pass (same as baseline)
2. No behavior changes detected
3. Improvement was achieved
4. Refactoring is ready to ship

**Include in the entry:**
- Motivation (why we refactored)
- Approach (how we did it)
- Improvement (what got better)
- Guideline (lesson for future)
- Files touched and searchable tags

## Output

When validation is complete:

**If passed:**
1. Summary of what was validated
2. Confirmation behavior is preserved
3. Improvement metrics achieved
4. Confirmation that LOGS.json was updated
5. Next steps:
   - `/03-SHIP/01-pre-commit` — Run pre-commit checks
   - `/03-SHIP/02-commit` — Just commit locally
   - `/03-SHIP/03-push` — Commit and push
   - `/03-SHIP/04-pr` — Commit, push, and create PR

**If failed:**
1. Clear list of issues found
2. Whether they're behavior changes or test failures
3. How to fix each one
4. Offer to adjust the refactoring
5. "Re-run `/03-validate-improvements` after fixes"

### Store Validation Insights in Memory

**If validation revealed useful patterns or insights not already documented**, store them for future sessions.

**Use the memory MCP tools:**

1. **For validation patterns discovered:**
   ```
   Use create_entities or add_observations to store in "ValidationPatterns":
   - Testing strategies that worked well (e.g., "For refactorings, compare before/after output for 10 representative inputs")
   - Subtle behavior areas (e.g., "String formatting in reports is sensitive — always diff the output")
   - What to watch for (e.g., "Refactoring async code often introduces subtle timing differences")
   ```

2. **For refactoring patterns:**
   ```
   Use create_entities or add_observations to store in "RefactoringPatterns":
   - Successful patterns (e.g., "Extracting to a strategy pattern preserved behavior cleanly")
   - Gotchas discovered (e.g., "The old code handled null differently than it appeared — preserve that quirk")
   ```

**Only store NEW findings** — insights that will help validate future refactorings. If nothing notable was discovered, skip this step.

**Example observations to store:**
- "Error message format matters to the frontend — don't change it during refactoring"
- "The order of keys in JSON responses is tested — sorting alphabetically breaks tests"
- "Performance tests should run before and after major refactorings to catch regressions"
