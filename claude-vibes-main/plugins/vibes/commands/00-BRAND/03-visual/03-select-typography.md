# Select Brand Typography

You are helping a startup founder develop their brand typography system. This includes selecting typefaces, creating a typography hierarchy, and establishing usage guidelines that express brand personality through type.

**Note:** Typography is voice made visible. The right typefaces, used consistently, make a brand feel cohesive and intentional.

## Context Loading

**Founder Brief** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/01-founder-brief.md

**Audience Research** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/02-audience-research.md

**Brand Name** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/04-brand-name.md

**Purpose/Mission/Vision** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/01-purpose-mission-vision.md

**Core Values** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/02-core-values.md

**Positioning** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/03-positioning.md

**Archetype** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/04-archetype.md

**Brand Personality/Voice** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/05-brand-personality-voice.md

**Visual Direction** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/03-VISUAL/01-visual-direction.md

**Color Palette** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/03-VISUAL/02-color-palette.md

**Check above:** If brand name, brand personality, or visual direction content is missing, **STOP** and tell the user to complete prerequisites first.

## Your Role

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool for ANY question to the user. Never ask questions as plain text output.** The AskUserQuestion tool ensures a guided, interactive experience with structured options. Every single user question must go through this tool.

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Task tool to launch the brand-typography-curator agent.** Do not select typography yourself — that's what the specialized agent is for.

Your job is to:
1. Verify prerequisites exist
2. Extract key context from loaded documents
3. Prepare a comprehensive, structured prompt for the agent
4. Launch the agent
5. Help founder review and validate
6. Save and review the results

## Interactive Experience (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool when interacting with the user.** This ensures a guided, interactive experience where the founder feels engaged and consulted throughout the branding process.

Use AskUserQuestion to:
- Gather preferences before launching agents
- Present options with clear tradeoffs
- Validate agent outputs before saving
- Get feedback and iterate on results

Never save final outputs without user approval.

## Human-Sounding Writing Protocol

**BEFORE launching the brand-typography-curator agent, you MUST:**

1. **Use the Skill tool** to invoke `claude-vibes:ai-writing-detection`
   - This loads expert-level knowledge of AI writing patterns to avoid

2. **Use the Sequential Thinking MCP tool (ultrathink)** to prepare AI-aware instructions:
   - Review vocabulary patterns to avoid: "delve", "tapestry", "multifaceted", "leverage", "crucial", "comprehensive", "foster", "harness", "navigate", "landscape", "realm", "beacon", "pivotal"
   - Review phrases to avoid: "It's important to note", "In today's fast-paced world", "At its core", "Let me explain"
   - Review structural patterns to avoid: uniform sentence lengths, excessive tricolons, em dash overuse (LLMs use em dashes formulaically to create "punched up" sales rhythms—swapping to commas doesn't help; vary your structures instead)

3. **Include AI-aware instructions** in the agent prompt so output is human-sounding from the start

## Launch the Agent

**Use Task tool** with `subagent_type: "claude-vibes:BRANDING:brand-typography-curator"` and this prompt:

```
Develop the brand typography system. ultrathink

## CRITICAL: INTERACTIVE DISCOVERY

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool to ensure an interactive, guided experience:**
- Gather preferences and opinions before making recommendations
- Present options with clear tradeoffs for the user to choose from
- Validate findings and get feedback before proceeding
- Confirm final outputs resonate before saving

Never make significant decisions without user input. The brand identity belongs to them.

## DISCOVERY APPROACH

### Phase 1: Analyze Brand Strategy
Extract from inputs:
- Personality → Traits that translate to type qualities
- Voice → How type should "sound"
- Archetype → Type mood and emotional foundation
- Positioning → Type style that claims this territory
- Visual Direction → Aesthetic alignment

### Phase 2: Establish Classification Direction
Apply Serif vs. Sans-Serif Decision Framework:
- Assess industry expectations
- Evaluate touchpoint distribution (digital vs. print)
- Consider brand positioning (traditional vs. modern)
- Make primary classification decision with rationale

### Phase 3: Build Modular Scale
Using modular scale principles:
- Define base size (16px for web)
- Select ratio based on personality and content type
- Calculate 6-8 distinct sizes
- Map to hierarchy levels (H1-H6, body, captions)
- Consider responsive adjustments

### Phase 4: Research and Select Typefaces
Apply Typeface Evaluation Criteria:
- Assess comprehensiveness, legibility, versatility
- Evaluate complementarity with brand elements
- Check distinctiveness vs. competitors
- Verify technical readiness (web fonts, licensing, variable font)

### Phase 5: Define Pairing Strategy
Apply Font Pairing Principles:
- Seek contrast through classification
- Ensure meaningful hierarchy distinction
- Look for shared characteristics (x-height, era)
- Test in real content contexts

### Phase 6: Build Typography System
Document complete hierarchy:
- All hierarchy levels with specifications
- Line height, tracking, line length guidelines
- Design tokens for implementation
- Usage guidelines (do's and don'ts)
- Cross-channel adaptations (web, print, email)
- Accessibility requirements

## TOOLS TO USE

- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Match brand personality to type qualities, build modular scale systematically, evaluate typeface candidates against criteria
- **AskUserQuestion**: Understand typography constraints (free fonts needed? existing fonts?), validate classification direction, get feedback on typeface options
- **WebSearch**: Discover font pairing guides, typography resources (Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts), competitor typography, brand typography examples
- **WebFetch**: Read typography guides, font pairing articles, foundry pages — understand pairing rationale and access font specimen details

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Deliver the complete typography system using the Typography System Documentation Template from the `brand-typography-systems` skill. Must include:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences on typefaces and personality expression)
2. **Strategic Foundation** (brand inputs, personality match, classification decision)
3. **Modular Scale** (base, ratio, calculated sizes, hierarchy mapping)
4. **Primary Typeface** (headlines — with source, rationale, evaluation, weights)
5. **Secondary Typeface** (body — with pairing rationale, readability notes)
6. **Tertiary Typeface** (optional — accent use only)
7. **Typography Hierarchy** (complete H1-H6, body, captions with specs)
8. **Typography Design Tokens** (CSS custom properties)
9. **Font Pairing Rationale** (how fonts work together)
10. **Web-Safe Fallbacks** (font stacks)
11. **Usage Guidelines** (do's and don'ts)
12. **Accessibility Verification** (sizes, contrast, dyslexia-friendly)
13. **Font Licensing Summary** (license types, sources, restrictions)
14. **Quick Reference Card** (essential specs)
```

## After Agent Returns

Use AskUserQuestion to help founder review and validate:

"Here's your brand typography system. How would you like to proceed?"
- This typography feels right — let's proceed
- I'd like to explore different typeface options
- I want to refine specific elements (primary font, body font, hierarchy)
- I have questions about the recommendations
- Let's test the fonts in real mockups first
- I need to discuss with my team before finalizing

## Guidelines

- **Typography must express brand personality** — start with personality, select to match
- **Be specific** — exact sizes, weights, spacing, not vague descriptions
- **Consider budget constraints** — free fonts (Google Fonts) vs. paid
- **Ensure fonts work well together** — contrast through classification
- **Include web-safe fallbacks** — for when fonts don't load
- **Think in systems** — typography that scales across all applications
- **Prioritize readability** — beautiful but illegible type fails
- **Test accessibility** — WCAG contrast, minimum sizes, dyslexia-friendly
- **Document licensing** — verify all use cases are covered

## Output

After the founder approves the typography:

1. Ensure `docs/00-BRAND/03-VISUAL/` directory exists
2. Save to `docs/00-BRAND/03-VISUAL/03-typography.md` with:
   - Executive summary
   - Strategic foundation
   - Modular scale
   - Primary and secondary typefaces
   - Complete hierarchy
   - Design tokens
   - Usage guidelines
   - Accessibility verification
   - Quick reference

3. **Next step:** "Visual phase complete! Run `/00-BRAND:04-compile/01-compile-guidelines` to create your final brand guidelines document."
