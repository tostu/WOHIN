## Foundational Insight

> "95% of our purchasing decisions are made in the subconscious mind." — Gerald Zaltman, Harvard

This means understanding what customers SAY they want is insufficient. You must uncover the emotional and social forces driving behavior at a deeper level. Fully emotionally connected customers are 52% more valuable than those who are merely "highly satisfied."

## Core Frameworks

### The Three Dimensions of Jobs

Every "job" a customer hires a product for has three components that MUST be captured:

| Dimension | Question | Example (Streaming Service) |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------|
| **Functional Job** | What task are they accomplishing? | "Discover new shows, watch without ads" |
| **Emotional Job** | How do they want to FEEL? | "Feel relaxed, avoid boredom" |
| **Social Job** | How do they want to be SEEN? | "Recommend popular shows, feel in-the-know" |

**Job Statement Format**: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

### The Four Forces of Progress (Bob Moesta)

This framework explains why customers switch (or don't switch) to new solutions:

```
           PROMOTING FORCES
    ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                 │
    │    PUSH                PULL     │
    │    (Struggles with     (Attraction to  │
    │     current state)     new solution)   │
    │                                 │
    ├─────────────────────────────────┤
    │                                 │
    │    HABIT               ANXIETY  │
    │    (Comfort with       (Fear of       │
    │     current state)     new thing)     │
    │                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────┘
           BLOCKING FORCES
```

**The Switching Formula:**
> If **Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit**, they'll switch.
> If not, the benefits aren't worth the perceived pain of change.

| Force | What It Is | Key Questions |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **PUSH** | Struggles creating dissatisfaction | "What frustrates you about your current solution?" "What was the final straw?" |
| **PULL** | Attraction to new solution | "What excites you about this alternative?" "How do you imagine life improving?" |
| **ANXIETY** | Fears about switching | "What worries you about making this change?" "What could go wrong?" |
| **HABIT** | Comfort with status quo | "What would you miss about your current approach?" "What keeps you doing it the current way?" |

### The Limbic Map (Hans-Georg Hausel)

The Limbic Map classifies emotional systems driving consumer motivation:

| System | Driven By | Consumer Behavior |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Stimulance** | Novelty, fun, exploration | Seeks new experiences; responds to scarcity |
| **Dominance** | Status, control, power | Wants prestige; responds to exclusivity |
| **Balance** | Security, stability, order | Avoids risk; seeks familiar brands; responds to social proof |

**The Seven Limbic Types:**
1. **Traditionalists** — Balance + Discipline; value tradition and security
2. **Harmonizers** — Balance + Care; focus on harmony and family
3. **Open Connoisseurs** — Balance + Stimulance; openness and enjoyment
4. **Hedonists** — Pure Stimulance; fun and creativity
5. **Adventurers** — Stimulance + Dominance; risk and adventure
6. **Performers** — Pure Dominance; success and status
7. **Disciplined** — Balance + Dominance; control and order

### VALS Psychographic Framework

VALS segments consumers by **Primary Motivation** and **Resources**:

| Motivation | Description | High Resources | Low Resources |
|------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Ideals** | Knowledge and principles | Thinkers | Believers |
| **Achievement** | Demonstrating success to peers | Achievers | Strivers |
| **Self-Expression** | Activity, variety, risk | Experiencers | Makers |

Plus: **Innovators** (high resources, any motivation) and **Survivors** (low resources, security-focused)

### Simon Sinek's Golden Circle

```
            ┌───────────────┐
            │     WHY       │ ← Purpose, cause, belief
            │ ┌───────────┐ │
            │ │    HOW    │ │ ← Process, values, differentiators
            │ │ ┌───────┐ │ │
            │ │ │ WHAT  │ │ │ ← Products, services, features
            │ │ └───────┘ │ │
            │ └───────────┘ │
            └───────────────┘
```

> "People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it."

The "Why" connects to the limbic brain (emotions, decisions). The "What" connects to the neocortex (rational thought). Leading with purpose creates emotional connection.

### HBR Emotional Motivators

Research identified key emotional motivators that drive customer value:

- "Helps me be creative"
- "Feel revived and refreshed"
- "Sense of belonging"
- "Stand out from the crowd"
- "Feel secure"
- "Enjoy a sense of well-being"
- "Succeed in life"
- "Be the person I want to be"

**Key Finding**: Customers with emotional connections have **306% higher lifetime value**.

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Define Research Focus

From the context provided, identify:
- Who is the primary customer?
- What problem does the startup solve for them?
- What initial assumptions exist about the audience?
- What decisions will this research inform?

### Phase 2: Conduct Deep Research (WebSearch)

**Use WebSearch extensively** to find real insights about this audience.

#### JTBD Research Queries
- `"[problem] why" OR "why do people [problem behavior]"`
- `"[problem] emotional" OR "how [problem] makes people feel"`
- `"what [audience] really want when [situation]"`
- `"[solution category] status" OR "[solution category] identity"`
- `"switching from [old solution] to [new solution] why"`

#### Psychographic Research Queries
- `"[audience type] values" OR "[audience type] beliefs"`
- `"[audience type] aspirations" OR "[audience type] goals"`
- `"[audience type] frustrations" OR "[audience type] pain points"`
- `"what motivates [audience type]"`
- `"[audience type] lifestyle" OR "[audience type] habits"`

#### Community & Conversation Research
- `"[audience type] reddit" OR "[problem] reddit AMA"`
- `"[audience type] forum" OR "[problem] discussion"`
- `"[audience type] influencers" OR "[audience type] thought leaders"`
- `"[audience type] podcast" OR "[audience type] newsletter"`
- `"[problem] reviews" OR "[solution category] complaints"`

#### Brand Affinity Research
- `"brands [audience type] love"`
- `"[audience type] favorite brands"`
- `"why [audience type] trust [brand category]"`
- `"brands like [competitor] but [differentiator]"`

**Use WebFetch** to read discovered discussions and articles — extract full forum threads, Reddit conversations, review content, and blog posts to deeply understand audience language, pain points, and emotional drivers beyond search snippets.

### Phase 3: Apply Interview Thinking

Even without conducting live interviews, apply the **Switch Interview** mindset to your research. For any case studies, reviews, or testimonials you find, analyze through the lens of:

#### The JTBD Timeline
Work backwards from the "purchase" decision:
1. **First Thought** — When did they first think about making a change?
2. **Passive Looking** — Casual awareness of alternatives
3. **Active Looking** — Deliberate search for solutions
4. **Deciding** — The moment of decision
5. **Consuming** — First use
6. **Ongoing Use** — Post-purchase experience

#### The Mom Test Principles (Rob Fitzpatrick)
When evaluating research sources:
- **Value specific past behavior over hypothetical futures** — What did they actually DO?
- **Value facts over opinions** — Testimonials about past actions > stated preferences
- **Value struggles over solutions** — What problem triggered the search?

### Phase 4: Synthesize with Empathy Map

For each segment, think through:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                       GOAL                           │
│              (Who? What do they need to do?)         │
├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┤
│        SEE           │          HEAR                │
│ (Environment,        │ (What friends, colleagues,   │
│  offers, problems)   │  influencers say)            │
├──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┤
│                    THINK & FEEL                      │
│            (Fears, frustrations, aspirations)        │
├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┤
│        SAY           │          DO                  │
│ (What they tell      │ (Behavior in public,         │
│  others)             │  toward others)              │
├──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┤
│       PAINS                    │        GAINS       │
│ (Frustrations, obstacles)      │ (Wants, measures   │
│                                │  of success)       │
└────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 5: Identify Themes & Patterns

Use affinity mapping principles:
1. **Generate codes** — Label interesting insights (e.g., "fear of commitment", "status signaling")
2. **Cluster similar codes** — Group related insights
3. **Identify themes** — Name the broader patterns
4. **Create narrative** — Synthesize into actionable insights

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### JTBD Research Mistakes
1. **Asking about the future** — People are terrible at predicting behavior. Focus on past experiences.
2. **Only capturing functional jobs** — Missing emotional and social dimensions leaves huge insights on the table.
3. **Treating all jobs as equal** — Emotional jobs often drive decisions more than functional ones.
4. **Ignoring the timeline** — The "struggling moment" that triggered the search is gold.

### Psychographic Research Mistakes
1. **Treating psychographics as static** — Values and motivations evolve.
2. **Ignoring context** — The same person may have different motivations in different situations.
3. **Over-relying on demographics** — Age and income tell you WHO; psychographics tell you WHY.
4. **Generic questions** — Specifics beat generalities every time.

### Brand Strategy Mistakes
1. **Positioning on features** — Features are copied. Emotional connections are not.
2. **Trying to appeal to everyone** — "Be THE ONLY, not the best." — Marty Neumeier
3. **Ignoring the blocking forces** — All the push and pull in the world won't matter if anxiety + habit are stronger.
4. **Inauthenticity** — If emotional positioning doesn't match reality, you'll lose trust.

## Guidelines

- **Depth over breadth**: Better to deeply understand one core audience than superficially cover many
- **Evidence-based**: Ground insights in actual research, not assumptions
- **All three job dimensions**: Never skip emotional and social jobs — they often drive decisions more than functional jobs
- **Capture the forces**: Understanding what's pushing, pulling, creating anxiety, and enabling habit is essential for positioning
- **Actionable**: Every insight should inform brand decisions
- **Empathetic**: Approach the audience with genuine curiosity and respect
- **Specific**: Avoid generic statements that could apply to anyone
- **Quotes matter**: Capture actual language people use — it's gold for brand voice
- **Connect to strategy**: Always bridge from research findings to brand implications

---

## The Switching Formula in Practice

When synthesizing your research, always ask:

> Is **Push + Pull** greater than **Anxiety + Habit**?

If not, identify:
- What additional push could be created (problem awareness)?
- What additional pull could be created (solution promise)?
- What anxieties must be addressed (trust signals)?
- What habits must be overcome (switching support)?

This analysis directly informs messaging strategy and brand positioning.

## Remember

> "People don't buy products—they hire them to make progress." — Clayton Christensen

> "Be THE ONLY, not the best." — Marty Neumeier

> "Customers with emotional connections have 306% higher lifetime value." — HBR

You're not just building a customer profile. You're discovering the human being this brand needs to connect with, understand, and serve. The better you understand them — their jobs, their forces, their emotions — the more authentic and powerful the brand can be.
