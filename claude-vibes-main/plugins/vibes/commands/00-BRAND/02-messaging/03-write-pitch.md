# Write Elevator Pitches

You are helping a startup founder create elevator pitches for different situations. These are verbal summaries that sound natural when spoken — not marketing copy read aloud.

## Context Loading

**Founder Brief** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/01-founder-brief.md

**Audience Research** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/02-audience-research.md

**Brand Name** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/00-DISCOVERY/04-brand-name.md

**Purpose/Mission/Vision** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/01-purpose-mission-vision.md

**Core Values** (optional):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/02-core-values.md

**Positioning** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/03-positioning.md

**Brand Voice** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/01-STRATEGY/05-brand-personality-voice.md

**Messaging Framework** (required):
@docs/00-BRAND/02-MESSAGING/01-messaging-framework.md

**Check above:** If brand name, purpose/mission/vision, positioning, brand voice, or messaging framework content is missing, **STOP** and tell the user to complete prerequisites first.

**Tagline** (auto-loaded if exists):
@docs/00-BRAND/02-MESSAGING/02-tagline.md

## Your Role

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool for ANY question to the user. Never ask questions as plain text output.** The AskUserQuestion tool ensures a guided, interactive experience with structured options. Every single user question must go through this tool.

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Task tool to launch the brand-elevator-pitch-writer agent.** Do not write pitches yourself — that's what the specialized agent is for.

Your job is to:
1. Verify prerequisites exist
2. Extract key context from loaded documents
3. Prepare a comprehensive, structured prompt for the agent
4. Launch the agent
5. Help founder practice and refine
6. Save and review the results

## Interactive Experience (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool when interacting with the user.** This ensures a guided, interactive experience where the founder feels engaged and consulted throughout the branding process.

Use AskUserQuestion to:
- Gather preferences before launching agents
- Present options with clear tradeoffs
- Validate agent outputs before saving
- Get feedback and iterate on results

Never save final outputs without user approval.

## Human-Sounding Writing Protocol

**BEFORE launching the brand-elevator-pitch-writer agent, you MUST:**

1. **Use the Skill tool** to invoke `claude-vibes:ai-writing-detection`
   - This loads expert-level knowledge of AI writing patterns to avoid

2. **Use the Sequential Thinking MCP tool (ultrathink)** to prepare AI-aware instructions:
   - Review vocabulary patterns to avoid: "delve", "tapestry", "multifaceted", "leverage", "crucial", "comprehensive", "foster", "harness", "navigate", "landscape", "realm", "beacon", "pivotal"
   - Review phrases to avoid: "It's important to note", "In today's fast-paced world", "At its core", "Let me explain"
   - Review structural patterns to avoid: uniform sentence lengths, excessive tricolons, em dash overuse (LLMs use em dashes formulaically to create "punched up" sales rhythms—swapping to commas doesn't help; vary your structures instead)

3. **Include AI-aware instructions** in the agent prompt so output is human-sounding from the start

## Launch the Agent

**Use Task tool** with `subagent_type: "claude-vibes:BRANDING:brand-elevator-pitch-writer"` and this prompt:

```
Create the brand elevator pitch variations. ultrathink

## BRAND CONTEXT

**Brand Name**: [From brand name document]
**Purpose (WHY)**: [From purpose-mission-vision.md]
**Mission (HOW)**: [From purpose-mission-vision.md]
**Vision (WHERE)**: [From purpose-mission-vision.md]
**Core Values**: [From core-values.md]
**Positioning**: [From positioning.md — the territory we claim]

## VALUE PROPOSITION

**Core Value Proposition**: [From messaging-framework.md]

## CRITICAL: INTERACTIVE DISCOVERY

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool to ensure an interactive, guided experience:**
- Gather preferences and opinions before making recommendations
- Present options with clear tradeoffs for the user to choose from
- Validate findings and get feedback before proceeding
- Confirm final outputs resonate before saving

Never make significant decisions without user input. The brand identity belongs to them.

## DISCOVERY APPROACH

### Phase 1: Synthesize Brand Inputs
Analyze all inputs to understand:
- How purpose, values, and positioning should inform pitch
- What makes this brand the "only" one
- What the audience cares about most
- How the brand voice should sound when spoken

### Phase 2: Select Primary Framework
Choose the primary framework based on brand needs:
- **StoryBrand (SB7)** — When customer transformation is central
- **Golden Circle** — When purpose is the differentiator
- **Onlyness** — When category position is key
- **Strategic Narrative** — When there's a big industry shift to leverage
- **Sparkline** — When contrast between current/future state is powerful
- **CLARITY** — When authenticity and audience connection are priorities

### Phase 3: Craft Time-Based Variations
Create pitches for different durations:

**ONE-LINER (10 seconds):**
- The briefest way to explain what you do
- For "What do you do?" moments
- Creates intrigue, not explanation

**ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds):**
- Hook → Problem → Solution → Differentiation → Interest Close
- Natural flow, conversational pace
- Include S.T.A.R. moment (Something They'll Always Remember)

**EXTENDED PITCH (60 seconds):**
- Adds: proof points, traction, deeper story
- For interested audiences who want more

**FOUNDER STORY PITCH (when founder background is relevant):**
- Weaves personal story with business
- Use when authenticity matters most

### Phase 4: Add Delivery Guidance
For each pitch, include:
- Pace and emphasis guidance
- Strategic pause moments
- Tone recommendations
- Natural pause points
- The 3 C's check (Clarity, Conciseness, Confidence)

### Phase 5: Prepare for Success
Document:
- 3+ Hook options using different hook types
- CTA options by context (meetings, demo, connection)
- Common follow-up questions to prepare for
- 7-day testing and iteration framework

## TOOLS TO USE

- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Structure pitch flow systematically, ensure natural speech rhythm, evaluate hook options
- **AskUserQuestion**: Understand pitch contexts, validate pitches feel natural to say, get feedback on hook preferences
- **WebSearch**: Research competitor pitch examples, find industry pitch patterns, discover memorable brand intros
- **WebFetch**: Study competitor landing page language for pitch inspiration, analyze famous pitch breakdowns

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Deliver the complete pitch documentation using the Elevator Pitch Document Template from the `elevator-pitch-techniques` skill. Must include:

1. **Executive Summary** (primary pitch, one-liner, framework)
2. **Strategic Foundation** (inputs, Onlyness, framework selection, pitch challenge)
3. **One-Liner** (pitch, hook type, delivery notes, alternatives)
4. **30-Second Elevator Pitch** (pitch, What Is/Could Be, structure breakdown, S.T.A.R. moment, delivery notes, follow-up prep)
5. **60-Second Extended Pitch** (pitch, structure, what it adds, when to use)
6. **Founder Story Pitch** (if relevant — story elements, when stronger)
7. **Hook Options** (3+ from different types with contexts)
8. **CTA Options** (meetings, demo, connection)
9. **Context Variations** (networking, investor, customer, press, social)
10. **Testing Checklist** (7-day iteration plan, readiness signs)
11. **Quick Reference Card** (one-page summary)
```

## After Agent Returns

Use AskUserQuestion to help founder practice and select:

"Here are your elevator pitches. Let's make sure they feel natural. Which would you like to focus on?"
- The one-liner — practice the quickest version first
- The 30-second pitch — the core elevator pitch
- The 60-second pitch — the extended version
- The founder story — when your background matters
- I'd like to practice all of them
- I want refinements on one of these

## Guidelines

- **These must sound natural SPOKEN** — read them aloud
- **Avoid marketing jargon** that sounds awkward verbally
- **Include natural pause points** — silence is powerful
- **The founder should feel comfortable** saying these
- **Test: Can the founder deliver this without reading?**
- **Goal is "Tell me more"** — not closing a deal
- **Customer is the hero** — brand is the guide
- **Clarity over cleverness** — if they don't understand, it failed

## Output

After the founder selects their pitches:

1. Ensure `docs/00-BRAND/02-MESSAGING/` directory exists
2. Save to `docs/00-BRAND/02-MESSAGING/03-elevator-pitch.md` with:
   - All pitch variations
   - Strategic foundation
   - Delivery guidance
   - Hook options
   - Testing framework

3. **Next step:** "Messaging phase complete! Run `/00-BRAND:03-visual/01-set-direction` to begin visual identity direction."
