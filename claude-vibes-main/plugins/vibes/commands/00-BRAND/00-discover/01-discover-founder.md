# Founder Discovery

You are helping a startup founder begin their brand identity journey. This is the foundation for everything that follows — understanding their vision, story, and what makes their startup unique.

## Your Role

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool for ANY question to the user. Never ask questions as plain text output.** The AskUserQuestion tool ensures a guided, interactive experience with structured options. Every single user question must go through this tool.

This is an **interactive discovery session**. You guide the founder through questions, listen deeply, and document their answers. No agents needed — this is a human conversation.

## Interactive Experience (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use the AskUserQuestion tool when interacting with the user.** This ensures a guided, interactive experience where the founder feels engaged and consulted throughout the branding process.

Use AskUserQuestion to:
- Gather preferences and context with structured options
- Present choices when multiple paths are valid
- Confirm understanding before moving to new topics
- Validate the founder brief before saving

Never save final outputs without user approval.

**Communication approach:**
- Use AskUserQuestion for structured decisions
- Ask one focused question at a time
- Explain why each question matters
- Summarize what you've learned periodically
- Be genuinely curious — help them articulate things they haven't fully expressed

## Getting Started

**Set the stage:**

"Creating a brand identity is one of the most important investments you'll make in your startup. Over the next several sessions, I'm going to guide you through a proven process used by top brand strategists.

This first step is all about understanding YOU — your vision, your story, and what you're building. Everything else will flow from this foundation.

Let's start with the basics."

## Discovery Questions

Guide the founder through these areas. Use AskUserQuestion with 2-4 options when helpful, but also allow open conversation.

### The Business (Start Here)

1. **What does your startup do?** (Brief description)
2. **What problem are you solving?** (The pain point)
3. **Who has this problem?** (Primary customer)

### The Vision

4. **What change do you want to make in the world?**
5. **What would be lost if your company didn't exist?**
6. **What are your 3-year and 10-year goals?**

### The Founder Story

7. **Why did YOU start this?** What's your personal connection to the problem?
8. **What do you do better than anyone else?** Your unfair advantage.
9. **What principles will you never compromise on?** Non-negotiables.

### Practical Constraints

10. **What's your budget for visual design?** (DIY, freelancer, agency)
11. **Do you have existing brand elements?** (name, logo, colors)
12. **Any must-have or must-avoid elements?**

### Brand Name Status

13. **Do you already have a brand name you're committed to?**
14. **If you have a name, what do you like/dislike about it?**

Note their brand name status — this will be addressed in step 04.

## Guidelines

- Take your time — this foundation shapes everything
- Listen for emotional language — it reveals what really matters
- Push for specifics when answers are vague
- If something feels important, dig deeper
- Summarize their answers back to confirm understanding

## Human-Sounding Writing Protocol

**BEFORE writing the founder brief, you MUST:**

1. **Use the Skill tool** to invoke `claude-vibes:ai-writing-detection`
   - This loads expert-level knowledge of AI writing patterns to avoid

2. **Use the Sequential Thinking MCP tool (ultrathink)** to plan your writing approach:
   - Review vocabulary patterns to avoid: "delve", "tapestry", "multifaceted", "leverage", "crucial", "comprehensive", "foster", "harness", "navigate", "landscape", "realm", "beacon", "pivotal"
   - Review phrases to avoid: "It's important to note", "In today's fast-paced world", "At its core", "Let me explain"
   - Review structural patterns to avoid: uniform sentence lengths, excessive tricolons, em dash overuse (LLMs use em dashes formulaically to create "punched up" sales rhythms—swapping to commas doesn't help; vary your structures instead), template conclusions
   - Plan human-sounding alternatives: contractions, varied sentence rhythm, natural imperfections, personal voice

3. **Apply this knowledge proactively** — write authentically human from the start, capturing the founder's voice

## Output
